;;; Commentary:

;; Provides ways to use the url library to perform HTTP POST requests.
;; See the documentation to `http-post-simple' for more information.
;;
;; The `url-http' library does not handle 1xx response codes.

;; However, as RFC 2616 puts it:
;;     a server MAY send a 100 (Continue)
;;     status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
;;     not include an Expect request-header field with the "100-continue"
;;     expectation.
;;
;; -- and some servers do, giving you annoying errors. To avoid these errors,
;; you can either set `url-http-version' to "1.0", in which case any compliant
;; server will not send the 100 (Continue) code, or call
;; `http-post-finesse-code-100'. Note that the latter advises
;; 'url-http-parse-response'
;;
;;; Change Log:

;; 11/06/2008 Set `url-http-version' to "1.0" when posting.
;; 19/07/2008 Don't set special variables like `url-http-version' and
;;	      `url-http-attempt-keepalives'.
;; 03/11/2008 Tell the server what charset we're using & accepting.
